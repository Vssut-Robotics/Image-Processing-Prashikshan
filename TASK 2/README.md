# Task 2

## Aim of the task :

1)Print the rows,columns,channels of the given image.
2)Print the intensity at the beginning centre of the image.
3)Draw contour,find area and perimeter of each contour.
4)Draw contour for maximum area,print the maximum area and print the maximum perimeter.
5)Convert an image to gray image.
6)Convert RGB image to red image ,(i.e, set green and blue components to zero).

Task Description:
First of all go through the video tutorials provided in the drive link and the reference links provided below:

Reference link:  
i)https://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/df2/tutorial_py_basic_ops.html

ii)https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/dd/d49/tutorial_py_contour_features.html

Don't limit yourself to only these, search for more  sources to learn about these topics. 

There will be a folder 'Image' which consists of two images.Write a program in python to perform the following operation on both the images:

1) Function A:This function should print the no of rows, columns,and no of channels of the given image. 

2) Function B: This function should print the value of the intensity(value of color triplet in the order red, green and blue) at the centre.
 

3) Function C:This function should generate a window to draw contour . Find the area and perimeter of each contour.Take the screenshot of the window as Name_img1_ss1.png and Name_img2_ss1.png respectively.

4) Function D:This function should generate a window to draw contour of the shape having maximum area.Find the its area and perimeter.
Take the screenshot of this window save it as Name_img1_ss2.png and Name_img2_ss2.png respectively.

5) Function E:This function should generate a window containing the gray scale image. Take the screenshot of this window and save it as Name_img1_ss3.png and Name_img2_ss3.png respectively. 

6) Function F: This function should generate a window containing the red image. In other words you need to set the blue and green channels to 0. Take the screenshot of this window and name it as Name_img1_ss4.jpg or Name_img2_ss4.png.

Perform all these operation on both the images provided in the drive link.

After the execution of all the above mentioned task,take the screenshot of the printed output page and save it as Name_output.jpg or Name_output.png.
