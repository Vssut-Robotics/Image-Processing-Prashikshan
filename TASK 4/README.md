# Task 4

## Aim of the task : The objective of this task is to calculate the angle (in degrees) between two points (the red dot and the green dot) on inner black ring.

Task Description:
Write a python code to fulfill the objective of this task. There will be 3 images on which you need to perform this task. All these 3 images will be present in the Image folder in the provided drive link. All the input images will be of similar format with the difference being the position of the red and green dots on the inner black ring. There is a Center called origin which is the center of all concentric circles located on the inner most white circle. Your logic is expected to calculate such angles for all the three images present in the Task 4 image processing folder of the drive link upto two decimal places accuracy.

Print the angles for the three images in the outpout screen and take the screenshots of the output for the three images and save them as Name_output.jpg/Name_output.png. 

Name the python file as name_task4.py

Verification Purpose:
Image 1 angle:124.02 degree
Image 2 angle:131.72 degree
Image 3 angle: 27.73 degree

Note:
1.Errors to a few degrees will be tolerated you must print the execute this task for the three images in a single run. Add snippet of the code while asking doubts in this forum.
2.Submission Format to be followed strictly.
3.Late submission will not be considered.
4.All your doubts are to be asked in this platform only. No doubts will be entertained if asked personally in any other mode. Solution to the doubts can be posted by anyone (not mandatory for only mentors to answer). Avoid repetition of questions by cross checking if the same question has already been asked.
