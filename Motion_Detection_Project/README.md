# Motion detection using OpenCV and Python:
    The objective of this project is to detect any motion in a room or a space using a webcam. When a motion is detected, an alert is flashed on the screen so as to let the use rknow about the detected motion.
    Also a recording of the webcam is stored in a file for future reference.
