Try to learn about thresholding and masking concepts and include this in the documentation.

 Don't limit yourself to only these, search for more  sources to learn about these topics.

Write a python code to detect a ball(or any other solid object of a particular shape preferably circular ,example you can also use bottle cap) of a single colour. You need to create trackbar for controlling the colour ranges and show two windows capturing the video from the web camera one with binary screen and the other one is the actual screen.You need to take the screenshot of the binary image ,where the object to be detected must be completely white and rest of the image must be black.In the actual screen,the required  object must be detected.
You need to perform this for two objects of different colours (they can have same shape but must be of different colour) individually.

After execution ,take the screenshot of window capturing actual video and save it as Name_obj1_ss1.png /Name_obj1_ss1.jpg for object 1 and Name_obj2_ss1.png /Name_obj2_ss1.jpg for object2  and then take the screenshot of the binary screen(with the object to be detected must be completely white) and save it as Name_obj1_ss2.png /Name_obj1_ss2.jpg for object1 and Name_obj2_ss2.png/Name_obj2_ss2.jpg for object2.
Make sure that each of the above screenshot must also include all the trackbars created.
Name the python script as Name_task 3.py.
